## InstantReplay Minecraft Plugin (1.8 - 1.17)

WARNING: Requires a MySQL database.

InstantReplay is a plugin to help administrators go back in time and view events that happened on their server. This is perfect when a staff member must deal with an accusation that usually needs recording proof, as they can just replay what happened.
<br/>
All a staff member has to do in this scenario, is the following:
1. Go to where the event occurred.
2. Start a replay using the `/instantreplay` command.
3. Watch the events unfold right in front of them.

Replay displays the events in chronological order and uses packets. This means that when an admin is viewing a replay, only they can see the changes and events that occurred.

InstantReplay is a very configurable plugin, with the config allowing changes to almost everything including permissions, messages and settings.
