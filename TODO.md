### To Add

- Joining other people's replay as a viewer (using a 4 digit hexadecimal code).
- Automatic database backups (toggle-able, disabled by default)
- Toggle different parts of the logging and replay (i.e. player movement, blocks, damage)
- Add more replay events (e.g. visualise item drops, crouch events, player hit events)
- Add warning when there are no events for a while, suggest skipping forward

### In The Works

- `/replay skip <time>` to skip to a certain timestamp or forward by _x_ seconds in a replay.
